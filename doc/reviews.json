The bar and restaurant are outside on the third floor, so if you're wanting to escape the heat, forget it, and neither is very busy, so I don't see how they can stay in business. We ate at the restaurant one evening, and it was fine. Our room on the 15th floor was fine, with a view of all the taller buildings around us. (We couldn't get a room with a view of Diamond Head, which costs $20-30 more, because the hotel was full, but there's a nice view of Diamond Head from the third floor pool, restaurant, bar.) Our room needed serious updating. The jalousie windows let in all the street noise, and it was considerable. Our first night was Halloween night, so with all the revelers, traffic, police sirens, etc., we couldn't sleep until after 3:30 a.m. We wouldn't stay here again unless we could be guaranteed an upgrade to a room that faces Diamond Head; they have the usual sealed windows that you see everywhere now. The WiFi was included, and worked well.",
